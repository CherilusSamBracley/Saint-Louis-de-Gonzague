# Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague
This is the place where i stored one of my computer science  project in high school 


This script in about a program in C who will first of all check you age
according the year of birth you will enter
After checking your age the program will determine two things
1-if you are older than 18
2-if you are less than 18
in order to let you realize an action.

This is not a graphical interface project but a CLI program
